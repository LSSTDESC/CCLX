# CCLX     
This repository collects examples for the usage of the LSST DESC [Core Cosmology Library](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/) (`CCL`) in python. 

The material in this repository was developed within the LSST DESC using LSST DESC resources. DESC users should use it in accordance with the [LSST DESC publication policy](http://lsstdesc.org/Collaborators). External users are welcome to use the code outside DESC in accordance with the licensing information below.

## Running on binder
These notebooks can be run online using [binder](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LSSTDESC/CCLX/master) (kudos to Antony Lewis for this). Note that some notebooks featuring functionality that hasn't yet been formally released may not run.

# CCL documentation

Further CCL documentation can be found in our [Readthedocs page](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ccl/). 
More examples can be found in our benchmark comparison notebooks [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/tree/master/examples) and in deprecated (pre-CCL v2) notebooks [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL/tree/v2.0.1/examples). The examples in this repository continue evolving to match developments in the CCL master branch, but you can find examples that are v2-compatible if you restrict to the first set of commits.
